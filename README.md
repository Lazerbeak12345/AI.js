# AI.js
A _learning_ Artificial Intelligence Robot written in Javascript

As you may have noticed, most open-source AI's don't actually learn.

In fact, these robots tend to have hard-coded responces that simulate human-like behavior, but are unsuitable because of the sad fact that they can't _ever_ learn what a strange phrase means unless a human re-codes them to understand.
