# AIR-bot
A _learning_ Artificial Intelligence Responder written in Javascript

As you may have noticed, most open-source AI's don't actually learn.(sorry Hubot, it's true)

In fact, these robots tend to have hard-coded responces that simulate human-like behavior, but are unsuitable because of the sad fact that they can't _ever_ learn what a strange phrase means unless a human re-codes them to understand.

This API is designed to let you have a robot that can change it's opinion about things.(Don't worry you can punish and/or reward it too)
